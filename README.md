# Adwaita Tweaks
I'm a fan of Adwaita and the default GNOME shell but there's a few minor annoyances I wanted to fix. This repository acts as my personal "dotfile" for the Adwaita GTK-3.0 theme and GNOME shell. The .css files rely on Adwaita and include some minor tweaks to improve the default GNOME experience. Trying to keep it as simple as possible.

## Current features
- Makes the top panel light and gradient to match the windows
- Makes the GNOME shell slightly transparent
- Removes the round corners from the top panel
- Removes the arrows from the popup menus
- Adds some space for the popup menus
- Shrinks the GTK-3.0 -headerbars
